Getting Started

These demos use the Gradle build system.

First download the demos by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
snapshot. (See the options on the right hand side.)

In Android Studio, use the "Open an existing Android Studio project", and select one of the demo directories (`demo-kotlin` or `demo-java`).

Alternatively use the `./gradlew build` command to build the project directly.

Don't forget to add your API key to the `gradle.properties` file for each demo.
